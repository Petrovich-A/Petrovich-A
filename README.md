I'm a CNC programmer with over 10 years of practical experience, specialized in launching units into production. Our compamny is the major global manufacturer of mining dump trucks. Working with coworkers in our department we deal with designing CNC machinery programs (applying G-code is a programming language for CNC machines) with following adjustment the machine for processing parts.

One upon time, while tightening :wrench: a regular nut for 32:nut_and_bolt: at work, I realized that I **want more from life**. 

However, taken by the idea of coding seeking new opportunities to change specialization and to grow as a **Java developer**. 
I chose to work in IT sphere because I've always been genuinely interested in technology, especially how fast it evolves. I want to be involved in the creation of something new. Consequently, I got involved into programming and would like to become a reliable team member growing into a confident professional developer in a year-two.

After looking at several programming languages I've chosen **Java** :100: Presently, I combine job’s duties with java learning.

### Here are some ideas that assosiatiated:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [JavaFX application](https://github.com/Petrovich-A/JavaFX)                     
- 🌱 Currently concentrated on Java learning, ameliorating my web application design proficiency with Spring Framework and Hibernate technology. No doubt, Enterprise Java Development is not the easiest thing, however I'd like to be part of a company that invents new software products and makes the customer's business easier and more efficient.
- :construction_worker: My previose position taught me to work independently without excessive anxiety of colleagues on minor occasions. I'm able to  find solutions of task by myself.
- :heavy_check_mark: Reading someone else's code is not scary for me. For instance, I'm used to adjust machine cutting paths or settings to optimize production for achieving required products quality. I have huge of experience in troubleshooting issues during the manufacturing process.
- :muscle: My interpersonale skills is my strenght. I'm taught myself to use my empathy and build work relations with colleagues of different personality types.
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: I believe people can change through working hard and getting out of your comfort zone.
