### Hi there 👋
I’m **Alexandr** :bowtie: My current specialization is CNC programmer. We write programs on G-code applying simple text editor or special software. G-code is a programming language for CNC machines. We use this language to tell a machine what to do or where to move and what path to follow.

One upon time, while tightening :wrench: a regular nut for 32:nut_and_bolt: at work, I realized that I **want more from life**. My current purpose is changing specialization. Consequently, I got involved in programming and would like to become a java developer.

After looking at several **programming languages** I chose **Java** :100: Presently, I combine job’s duties with java learning.

### Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on final Epam's training project Java web application https://github.com/Petrovich-A/CNC-programs-storage
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spring
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on people who have entered in IT sfere
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Mockito usecases
- 💬 Ask me about How difficult it's to combine work duties and study programming
- 📫 I believe people can change through working hard and getting out of your comfort zone :seedling:
- ⚡ Fun fact: spent a lot of time to run project using Intellij IDEA, wich have run on Eclipse

## At the present time looking for Java juniour developer :raising_hand:
