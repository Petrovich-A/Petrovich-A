### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Alexandr :bowtie: My current specialization is CNC programmer. We write programs on G-code applying simple text editor or special software. G-code is a programming language for CNC machines. We use this language to tell a machine what to do or where to move and what path to follow.
One upon time, while tightening :wrench: a regular nut for 32 at work :nut_and_bolt:, I realized that I want more from life. My current purpose is changing specialization. Consequently, I got involved in programming and would like to become a java developer.
After looking at several programming languages I chose Java. Presently, I combine jobâ€™s duties with java learning.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on final Epam's training web app project using java 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web app layer architectyre and other patterns, SQL
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on people who have entered in IT sfere 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with simple functions in web app like authorization, pagiation e.t.c
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« I believe people can change through working hard and getting out of your comfort zone :seedling:
- âš¡ Fun fact: spent a lot of time to run project using Intellij IDEA, wich have run on Eclipse
